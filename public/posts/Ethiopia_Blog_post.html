    <p><b>The 1st accelerometer data captured the 24-hour movement behaviour of Ethiopian preschool children.</b></p>

    <p><b>Chalchisa Abdeta</b>, PhD candidate and chief investigator of the SUNRISE Study Ethiopia, shared his country
        experience. The Ethiopia team began data collection in the phase 3 pilot study in April 2022. So far, only a
        small number of studies reported 24-hour movement behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep)
        among preschool children in Africa and none from Ethiopia. Thanks to the SUNRISE International Study, the 1st
        accelerometer data captured the 24-hour movement behaviour of 400 preschool children (urban: 200, rural: 200)
        from April to September 2022 to examine adherence to the WHO 24-hour movement behaviour guidelines and
        association with development and health outcomes.</p>

    <p>It was our first time conducting the study with an accelerometer device. Our team have received capacity-building
        training from Senior Professor Anthony Okely, the Principal investigator of the SUNRISE International Study,
        over zoom and in person at Adama, Ethiopia. Representatives from the local stakeholders attended the meeting
        from the Federal Ministry of Health, Oromia Regional Health Burau and Adama Hospital Medical College.</p>

        <b>Challenges:</b>
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li><b>Challenge with getting consent in the urban area:</b>
            <p>The nature of the study was new for Ethiopia, and we faced a challenge with getting consent at the
                initial stage. Initially, almost all parents had no interest in the study due to the myth of the
                accelerometer, "wearing monitors for five days may affect our children", even if we explained the
                reality well. Some parents said that "the device may suck our kid's blood". More educated parents
                gradually accepted our briefing about the device and received some consent. Then, we used different
                approaches. For instance, we sent an invitation letter with leaflets in two local languages and briefing
                the information for the kindergarten staff to convince more parents. We recognized that parents accept
                the information from the kindergarten staff than data collectors. It might be due to pre-established
                communication between early childhood educators and parents. Gradually, we recruited the required number
                of children per week from 1-2 centres. Our team convinced the children that they should wear the device
                day and night for five days, and the children were happy to wear it and even protected their family by
                not to remove when going to bed and taking showers.</p>
        </li>
        <li><b>Challenge with limited access to accelerometer devices:</b>
            <p>The SUNRISE International Study is undergoing in more than 50 countries. Providing sufficient devices
                might be challenging. Ethiopia's team received 20 accelerometer devices. Children are expected to wear
                the device for five days. As a result, we only collect a maximum of 20 data per week due to limited
                access to accelerometer devices. Besides, some parents might withdraw from the study. Hence, it took
                about six months to complete about 400 data collection in Ethiopia. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>

        <b>Opportunities:</b>
    </p>
    
    <b>Kindness of rural peoples</b>
    <p>Unlike urban areas, parents were very cooperative and happy to engage in the study. Initially, we have gave
        briefing about the study and consent taking process to the community health workers. More than required number
        of parents agreed to get involved in the study in each Kebele, the lowest administrative structure. All parents
        those gave consent showed strong willingness to bring their child into the nearest health post every other day
        during the study. But reaching some health posts is quite challenging due to poor road infrastructure and the
        rainy season.

    <hr />
    <p>Despite those challenges, we completed the urban and rural data collection with a low non-response rate. About
        400
        children have worn accelerometer devices continuously for five days. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the
        data
        collectors, parents/children, and all individuals for their continuous support for the success of completing
        this
        data collection.</p>
