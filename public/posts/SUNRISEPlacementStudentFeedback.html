<p class="has-text-align-center">For the past 13 weeks, we have been joined by University of Wollongong Health and Society placement students, Claudia Maddren and Hamad Aldughdugh. Below, read what Claudia and Hamad had to share regarding their experience. Thank you, Claudia and Hamad, for all your hard work!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>In Spring 2020, I was fortunate to have been allocated my first choice for my Social Science Project with SUNRISE at Early Start, UOW. I was drawn to this opportunity as I had limited knowledge of the public health issue and wanted to challenge myself to learn new quantitative and workplace skills. More importantly, I wanted to contribute to a study that would help improve the health and well-being of young children.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>For my project, I focused on the associations between screen-time use and sleep behaviours within the Australian SUNRISE Pilot study sample. To complete my project, I performed a broad scope literature review, statistical analysis and presented the findings in a final report. A notable finding of the report was that Australian children that used an electronic screen device in the two-hours before bed went to bed an average of 29 minutes later and woke up an average of 14 minutes later than those that did not use a screen before bed.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>From my time with the SUNRISE Team, I have built upon my research skills especially within SPSS software and presenting results, both written and verbal. It was great to experience time in a research office environment and attend fortnightly meetings learning what is happening with SUNRISE teams across the world.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>I would like to thank the SUNRISE Team at Early Start, in particular my supervisors Katharina and John for their mentorship. I look forward to continuing working with the SUNRISE Team in 2021 to complete my honours thesis!</em></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>My work was focused on acceptability and feasibility of online training quizzes of motor skills tests for data collectors of the SUNRISE project exploring cultural, linguistic, geographic and socio-economic factors.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>While a new practical experience for me, I was able to draw on communication, collaboration and teamwork skills, including support from peers and colleagues, developed during my academic studies at UOW</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>I found the responsibility and pressure to deliver my work rewarding.<br />I further developed my skills in drawing out tacit knowledge and discussing the findings with participants and project members. I enjoyed having access to experts to test my ideas, discuss findings and present recommendations to identified causes in a combination of both business and academic environments.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>The latter experience has strengthened my confidence when facing an issue for the first time and having to address uncertainty, and that working in a team can improve results and reduce stress.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Overall, I now have capabilities, having developed my academic skills with practical professional experience in a real life project with detailed and complex work guided by experts in their respective fields.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>I have also developed my lateral thinking, particularly when faced with novelty, uncertainty and complexity posed to my participants in Australia, Singapore, Papua New Guinea, India and Pakistan by COVID-19 restrictions.</em></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center"><em>Finally, I made new friends in the workplace and I hope the friendships will grow.</em></p>
