            is the third country to commence data collection for the SUNRISE Main Study. The team reported that data
            collection is progressing nicely. Since their training in February 2021, they<b> </b>have visited 5
            preschool centres for the SUNRISE Main Study and have successfully assessed over 115 children. They have
            recently recruited 3 more preschool centres; with data collection scheduled in these centres in the coming
            weeks. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span>In Sweden, most children and personnel are on summer vacation during June-August, so the SUNRISE team will not
            collect data during that time period, however during this time they will begin planning for more data
            collection to re-commence in Autumn. </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">
        <span>Sweden previously collected Pilot Study data for SUNRISE in early 2019 and are continuing to show their strong
            research skills and dedication to understanding movement behaviours globally. </span></p>
