    <h1 style="text-align: center;">SUNRISE NEWSLETTER September-October 2021</h1>
    <hr />
    <p><span style="color: #000000;">The past two months brings with it a lot of good news from the SUNRISE team.</span>
    </p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">On a very positive note, many countries are now seeing an ease in COVID-19 case
            numbers and as a result, restrictions on movements and activities are beginning to lift. Most importantly,
            this brings with it opportunities to connect more with those who are closest to us, our friends, and
            families. Moreover, pertinent to the SUNRISE Study, this allows for the renewal of research
            activities.</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">This month Professor Tony Okely has had the pleasure of <strong>training three more
                Phase 3 countries: Mongolia, Chile &amp; Mexico.</strong> What an amazing group of professionals
            committed to improving children’s health. Thank you to all involved, we look forward to working with you and
            seeing the results of your pilot study!</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">In more good news, <strong>Japan and Sweden hav</strong><strong>e both recommenced
                data collection for the SUNRISE Main Study</strong>. Japan began data collection on the 20<sup>th</sup>
            of October and have already collected data on more than 20 children, what a terrific way to begin. Sweden
            has picked up from where they left off before their summer vacation and have successfully assessed over 140
            children, and with an incredible compliance rate. We are very lucky to have such fantastic researchers
            within the SUNRISE Study.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Team Morocco ha</strong><strong>ve been spotted out and about
                celebrating</strong> the finalisation of the SUNRISE Pilot study. We love to see our teams staying
            connected, supporting one another, and celebrating the wins – team Morocco, you deserve it!    </span></p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;"><img class="aligncenter"

                width="300" height="146" /></span></p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">The end of 2021 will see an additional three Phase 3 countries trained and
            commencing data collection, with Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Malawi, in the preparation stages of the pilot
            study; and if all goes as planned, an additional 11 Phase 3 countries and 3 Main Study countries, will
            commence before the year ends or in early 2022. We definitely have a busy few months ahead of us!</span></p>

    <p><span style="color: #000000;">Finally, I would like to end this update to say a huge congratulations to Najmeh
            Hamzavi Zarghani from SUNRISE Iran who has recently sat her defence meeting for her PhD!  </span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
