        <p><span style="color: #000000;">On October 12 -14 ISPAH held their 8<sup>th</sup> annual virtual congress. The
                        congress brought together thought-leaders, policy makers, community leaders, Indigenous elders,
                        and
                        researchers from all over the world for conversation, debate, and innovation based on the theme
                        of “The

        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Background</strong>: COVID-19 restrictions have had an unfavourable
                        impact
                        on children’s physical activity and screen time. The link between children’s movement behaviour
                        and parental
                        mental health is not well understood in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where the
                        pandemic has had
                        a profound impact.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Purpose</strong>: To explore the relationship between parent stress and
                        child movement behaviours in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and India during the pandemic.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Methods</strong>: The sample comprises 30 parents with children aged 3
                        - 4
                        years. Parents were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews and a pandemic impact
                        questionnaire, via phone, exploring their stress levels and their child’s movement behaviours,
                        during the
                        pandemic.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Results</strong>: Parents reflected on concerns regarding their child’s
                        lack of physical activity, and the amount of time their child was spending in screen time.
                        Parents reported
                        taking on different roles, and juggling complex responsibilities, influencing their motivation
                        and ability
                        to promote movement and play. This is further compounded by limited safe play spaces.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusions</strong>: Parents and caregivers have an important role to
                        play
                        in encouraging children’s healthy movement behaviours, particularly in circumstances where
                        additional family
                        supports (e.g. childcare, grandparents) are not available. Parents require readily-accessible
                        information
                        regarding promotion of healthy movement behaviours in the home environment, particularly in
                        LMICs. We need
                        to think beyond the impact of restrictions on the physical activity and screen time of children,
                        to the
                        impact this may have on parental stress and mental health.</span></p>

                                children: SUNRISE pilot study results from 19 countries</strong></span></p>

        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Background:</strong> There is a paucity of data from low- and
                        middle-income
                        countries on sedentary behaviour (SB) patterns during early childhood. Purpose: The purpose of
                        this study
                        was to examine how device-measured SB in young children differed across geographically,
                        economically, and
                        socio-demographically diverse populations, in an international sample.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Methods:</strong> This multinational, cross-sectional pilot study
                        included
                        data from 1071 children from 19 countries, collected between 2018 and 2020. SB was measured for
                        three
                        consecutive days using activPAL accelerometers. Sedentary time, sedentary fragmentation, and
                        seated
                        transport duration were calculated using PAL Analysis Algorithms and a custom-made analysis
                        program. Linear
                        mixed models were used to examine the differences in SB variables between sex, country-level
                        income groups,
                        caregiver education levels, urban/rural location, and population density.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Results:</strong> Children spent 56% (7.4 hrs) of their waking time
                        sedentary, and 42% accrued at least one sedentary bout/day lasting ≥60 min. The longest average
                        bout
                        duration was 81.1±45.4 min, and an average of 61.1±50.1 min/day was spent in seated transport.
                        Children from
                        upper-middle-income and high-income countries spent a greater proportion of the day sedentary,
                        accrued more
                        sedentary bouts, had shorter breaks between sedentary bouts, and spent significantly more time
                        in seated
                        transport, than children from low- and lower-middle-income countries. Few differences were found
                        in SB
                        patterns when comparing between urban/rural settings and caregiver education levels within each
                        country-level income group, while multiple significant differences were found when comparing
                        between
                        country-level income groups. Higher population density was correlated with several higher SB
                        measures.</span></p>
        <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Conclusions:</strong> These data provide greater understanding of young
                        children's SB patterns globally and the influences of country income urban/rural setting,
                        caregiver
                        education levels, and population density. Country income levels and population density appear to
                        be stronger
                        drivers of the observed differences than sex, rural or urban residential setting, or caregiver
                        educational
                        attainment. Funding: The SUNRISE pilot studies were supported by Early Start, University of
                        Wollongong.</span></p>
