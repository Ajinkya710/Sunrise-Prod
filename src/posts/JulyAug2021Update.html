    <p>Although it has been a challenging time to conduct research, we are happy to share that many of our SUNRISE teams
        have been lucky enough to continue with their data collection safely and have persevered through the
        ever-changing restrictions brought about due to the pandemic. We currently have <strong>Sweden, Papua New
            Guinea, and the United States of America</strong> collecting data for the Main Study and
        <strong>Nigeria</strong> collecting data for the Phase 3 Pilot Study.

    <p>And we would like to give a shout out to <strong>SUNRISE Morocco for completing their data collection for the
            Phase 3 Pilot Study – Bravo!</strong></p>

    <!-- wp:paragraph -->
    <p>We are also happy to announce that during August two of our teams participated in the <strong>online SUNRISE
            training</strong> with Prof Tony Okely and are looking to begin data collection very soon: <strong>SUNRISE
            Japan for the Main Study and SUNRISE Finland for the Phase 3 Pilot Study.</strong> It was an absolute
        pleasure getting to know both these teams and we look forward to working with you further to better understand
        and improve the movement behaviours of children!</p>
